// Usage:
// The new code can be used in two ways:

// As a Module:

// import { reorderbot } from './reorderbot_optimized';

// // Call with custom domain and phone
// const result = await reorderbot('customdomain.com', '+1234567890');

// // Or use defaults
// const result = await reorderbot();

// Standalone Execution:
// node reorderbot_optimized.ts

Looking at the reorderbot_optimized.ts file, I'll explain what is returned by the reorderbot() function.

The reorderbot() function returns a complete workflow result as an object containing several key pieces of information, or null if there was an error during processing.

When successful, the reorderbot() function returns an object with the following properties:

user: Contains the user profile information (UserRow type) with details like id, email, and other profile data.

customer: Contains the customer record (CustomerRow type) associated with the user, including fields like first_name, last_name, and other customer-specific information.

lastOrder: Contains information about the customer's last order, which may be either an existing order retrieved from the database or a newly created one based on a default template.

proposedOrder: Contains the proposed order data (EnhancedProposedOrder type) prepared for the agent, including:

Customer ID and tenant ID
Order status (set to "draft")
Order total
Creation and update timestamps
Proposed date
List of order items with enhanced product details (name, description, size, etc.)
Call ID (set to "pending")
Customer information (first name, last name, email)
Tenant name
tenant: Contains the complete tenant information object, including:

Tenant ID
Name
Domain
Any other tenant-specific fields from the database
Here's a visualization of the returned object structure:

{
user: {
id: "user-uuid",
email: "example@email.com",
// other user properties
},
customer: {
id: "customer-uuid",
first_name: "John",
last_name: "Doe",
// other customer properties
},
lastOrder: {
id: "order-uuid",
// other order properties
},
proposedOrder: {
customer_id: "customer-uuid",
tenant_id: "tenant-uuid",
status: "draft",
total: 79.98,
created_at: "2025-05-23T12:00:00Z",
updated_at: "2025-05-23T12:00:00Z",
proposed_date: "2025-05-23T12:00:00Z",
order_items: [
{
product_id: "product-uuid",
quantity: 2,
price: 39.99,
product_description: "Description of product",
product_size: "Medium",
product_name: "Product Name"
},
// more order items
],
call_id: "pending",
customer_first_name: "John",
customer_last_name: "Doe",
customer_email: "john.doe@example.com",
tenant_name: "Acme Cleaning"
},
tenant: {
id: "tenant-uuid",
name: "Acme Cleaning",
domain: "acmecleaning.com"
// other tenant properties
}
}

If something goes wrong during processing, like failing to get the tenant information or initialize the default order template, or if an error occurs during the user workflow, the function returns null and logs an appropriate error message.

This comprehensive return value provides all the necessary information for the calling code to handle the reordering process, with complete details about the user, customer, their previous and proposed orders, and the tenant context.
