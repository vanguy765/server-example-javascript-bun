# Reorderbot Code Refactoring

This document explains the refactored structure of the Reorderbot API, which is responsible for initiating outbound sales calls using a voice AI assistant.

## Refactoring Goals

The code has been refactored to:

1. **Improve Organization**: Separate concerns into smaller, focused modules
2. **Improve Readability**: Add comprehensive comments and clear function names
3. **Enhance Maintainability**: Make code easier to update and extend
4. **Reduce Complexity**: Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable pieces

## Code Structure

### Main Components

- `reorderbot_refactored.ts`: The main API endpoint that orchestrates the entire process
- `utils/`: A directory containing utility modules with specific functionality

### Utility Modules

1. **queryBuilder.ts**

   - Contains the `buildDynamicQuery` function for flexible database queries
   - Handles column selection, filtering, relationships, sorting, and pagination

2. **orderService.ts**

   - Functions for fetching and processing order data
   - Calculates order totals, taxes, and formats order data

3. **productService.ts**

   - Functions for fetching and processing product data
   - Handles product specials and customer favorite products
   - Calculates discounted prices

4. **assistantConfig.ts**

   - Functions for configuring the voice assistant
   - Builds prompts from template files
   - Defines assistant tools

5. **vapiService.ts**
   - Functions for making API calls to the VAPI service
   - Handles outbound call initiation

## How to Use

1. Import the necessary modules:

```typescript
import { reorderbotRoute } from "./api/reorderbot_refactored";
```

2. Add the route to your Hono app:

```typescript
app.route("/api/reorderbot", reorderbotRoute);
```

3. Make POST requests to the endpoint with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "phoneNumberId": "phone-number-id",
  "assistantId": "assistant-id",
  "customerNumber": "+1234567890"
}
```

## Improvements

- **Modularity**: Each module focuses on a specific concern
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript interfaces for better type checking
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and JSDoc annotations
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging
- **Testability**: Functions are easier to test in isolation

## Future Enhancements

- Add unit tests for each module
- Implement proper database logging of call results
- Add authentication and authorization
- Create a unified error handling system
- Enhance monitoring and observability
