I'll help you understand what each of these scripts does by examining their source files.

# See package.json for scripts

Let me explain what each script does:

1. `gen:types` (scripts/generate-types.ts):

- Primary purpose: Generates TypeScript types directly from your Supabase database
- Has two approaches:
  a. First tries to use the Supabase CLI to generate types
  b. Falls back to database introspection if CLI fails
- Outputs:
  - Generates TypeScript types for your database schema
  - Creates types for Row, Insert operations
  - Saves the output to `src/supabase/generated.types.ts`

2. `gen:schema-types` (scripts/introspect-schema.ts):

- More comprehensive type generation that includes:
  - TypeScript types for database tables
  - Zod validation schemas
  - Repository classes
  - Enum types
- Outputs multiple files:
  - `generated.types.ts` - TypeScript types
  - `generated.schemas.ts` - Zod validation schemas
  - `generated-repo.ts` - Generated repository classes
  - `generated.enums.ts` - Enum type definitions
- Uses a custom `SchemaIntrospector` class for detailed schema analysis

3. `analyze:schema` (examples/query-schema-and-generate.ts):

- This is more of an analysis and documentation tool
- It:
  - Queries and analyzes your database schema
  - Creates detailed reports for each table
  - Generates documentation in a `schema-report` directory
- For each table, it documents:
  - Column information
  - Primary keys
  - Generated TypeScript interfaces
  - Generated Zod schemas
- Also includes enum type analysis
- Primarily meant as an example/documentation tool

Here's a quick comparison:

| Script             | Primary Purpose                   | Output                                               | Best Used When                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `gen:types`        | Basic type generation             | Single types file                                    | You just need TypeScript types quickly      |
| `gen:schema-types` | Comprehensive code generation     | Multiple files with types, schemas, and repositories | You need full type safety and validation    |
| `analyze:schema`   | Schema analysis and documentation | Documentation reports                                | You need to analyze or document your schema |

The recommended usage would be:

- Use `gen:types` during development for quick type updates
- Use `gen:schema-types` when you need complete type safety and validation
- Use `analyze:schema` when you need to understand or document your database structure
