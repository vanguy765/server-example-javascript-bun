Supabase CLI Type Generation Report
Problem Overview
We've been working on creating a CLI-based approach to generate TypeScript types, Zod schemas, and enum types from a Supabase database schema. The main challenge has been that the traditional API-based approach fails because it attempts to access PostgreSQL system tables (like information_schema.tables), which are restricted by Supabase for security reasons.

Current State
Generated File: We have a generated-repo.ts file that appears to be successfully generated, containing type-safe repository functions for interacting with the database.

Script Implementation: We attempted to create a cli-generate-types.ts script that would:

Use supabase CLI commands instead of direct API calls
Extract the project reference ID
Generate TypeScript types
Generate Zod schemas
Extract enum types
Key Learnings
Project Reference ID: Supabase projects are identified by reference IDs rather than UUIDs or names as initially assumed. The CLI output format differs from what we expected.

TypeScript Integration: We found that the repository needs access to TypeScript compiler API to parse generated types into Zod schemas.

Generated Output: The generation appears to have created at least one file (generated-repo.ts), but we're uncertain if all required files (generated.types.ts, generated.schemas.ts, and generated.enums.ts) were successfully created.

File Structure: The repository pattern implementation has been generated with type-safe methods (getAll(), getById(), create(), update(), and delete()), but the Database type isn't properly imported in the file.

Timestamp Issues: The file's timestamp (2025-05-23) appears to be incorrect, which might indicate an issue with the generation process.

Technical Challenges
CLI Output Parsing: The Supabase CLI output format for project listing doesn't match our expected pattern, making it difficult to automatically extract project IDs.

Type Generation: The TypeScript compiler API usage for transforming types to Zod schemas requires careful handling of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes.

Error Handling: The current approach doesn't have robust error handling for CLI command failures.

Missing Type Definitions: The generated repository file references a Database type that isn't imported, indicating incomplete type generation.

Next Steps
Fix CLI Command Parsing: Update the regex pattern to correctly extract project reference IDs from Supabase CLI output.

Improve Type Generation: Ensure the generated files correctly import all required types and interfaces.

Add Proper Error Handling: Enhance the script with better error handling and reporting for each step of the generation process.

Generate All Required Files: Make sure all three required files (generated.types.ts, generated.schemas.ts, and generated.enums.ts) are properly generated.

Add Validation: Add a validation step to verify that all generated files contain the expected content and are correctly formatted.

Manual Fallback Option: Implement a more robust fallback mechanism that allows users to explicitly provide a project reference ID when automatic detection fails.

Conclusion
While we've made progress in understanding how to approach this problem using the Supabase CLI, the current solution is not yet fully functional. The key technical challenges revolve around correctly parsing CLI output and ensuring the TypeScript compiler API correctly transforms the types into Zod schemas. With the insights gained, we can improve the script to make it more robust and reliable.
